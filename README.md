# üöÄ Enterprise-Grade Stock and Operations Management System  
### Multi-Channel Inventory Control with Analytics, GPS, and AI Support

---

> **Note:** This system is developed as part of our **Final Year Project** and also contributes to our **Final Exam assessment**. The project simulates enterprise-level software built to handle real-world inventory challenges across multi-branch businesses. All development and collaboration are managed through GitHub.

## üìä Project Overview

This platform is a fully integrated inventory and operations system that empowers businesses to manage products, warehouses, orders, and analytics across multiple locations and user roles.

It includes:
- **A manager/admin interface** for backend operations, inventory control, supplier handling, and reporting.
- **A customer interface** for browsing, ordering, tracking, and interacting with AI-powered support.
- **Intelligent components** like a chatbot for assistance and GPS mapping for delivery tracking.
- **Third-party connectivity** to allow integration with email systems, SMS gateways, and potentially online stores.

üß† Use Cases

1. Inventory Manager ‚Äì Real-time Branch Replenishment

Sarah, an inventory manager, logs in and sees that the Kigali branch is low on ‚ÄúBluetooth Earbuds.‚Äù She uses the warehouse dashboard to transfer surplus stock from the Nyamirambo branch. The system updates inventory in real time and logs the transaction.

2. Customer ‚Äì Seamless Ordering and Delivery Tracking

Jean browses products and places an order through the customer interface. After checkout, he receives an email confirmation and can track delivery through an interactive GPS map.

3. Admin ‚Äì Audit and Oversight

David, the system admin, exports monthly supplier performance reports and verifies staff activity through the audit log. He uses these insights to brief upper management.

4. ChatBot ‚Äì 24/7 Self-Service Support

A customer wants to know if a wristband is available in medium. Instead of waiting for staff, they ask the chatbot, which instantly provides the size options based on current inventory.

5. General Manager ‚Äì Data-Driven Decision Making

Claire, a general manager, filters order fulfillment rates by branch. She notices delays in one region and adjusts that branch‚Äôs reorder threshold, preventing future bottlenecks.
